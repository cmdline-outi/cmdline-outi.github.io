## Introduction

Hi, my name is Outi. I do not want to add my surname here since this webpage is publicly available for everyone on the internet to view. I replaced my surname  with "CmdlineC" - I hope that is okay.

My major at university is linguistics. I'm focusing on general linguistics and not on language technology but I thought that this command line course could still be useful for me. My minor is East Asian studies.

My hobbies are art, jogging and reading. My favourite things to do on my free time are drawing and painting so I spend a lot of time creating art. I am very interested in the Japanese culture and language and I also enjoy learning languages in general.
